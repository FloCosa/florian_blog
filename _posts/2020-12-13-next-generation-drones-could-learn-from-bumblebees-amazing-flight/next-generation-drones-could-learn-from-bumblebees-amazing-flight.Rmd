| Researchers? | University of New South Wales Canberra |

| Published in? when (if mentioned)? | PNAS (23 November 2020) |
| General topic | We are talking here about the skill and precision of the bumblebee's flight to inspire us to create effective drones. |
| Procedure/what was examined | Bumblebees are tested and they can fly through holes of different sizes and even move sideways efficiently. We discovered in them a sort of spatial awareness of their body and a perception of depth like us. |
| Conclusions/discovery | We can therefore be inspired by them to create the next generations of drones that can be autonomous and do complex actions as insects manage to do. |
